# Bouncing Box Game: Part 1
We're going to create a simple game where a box moves across the screen at an increased speed after each click.Bouncing Box Game: Part 1

### Why is indentation important?

[Practice indentation here](http://togakangaroo.github.io/apps/indentation-merge/)

### Let's make a little game

[Will look like this](http://jsbin.com/lutuhu/1)

* Visit Cloud 9
* Create an HTML5 workspace
* Click the 'Start Editing'button

### TODO 1: Document What We’re Doing

### TODO 2: Create Structure Outline

### TODO 3: Create and Style Box

### TODO 4: Learn how to move the box

### TODO 5: Add jQuery library

`<script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.min.js></script>`

### What is a library?

### The game loop

* Do xxx several times per second
* Move the box over to the left 10 times per seconds

### What’s a Millisecond?

1000ms = 1sec
500ms = ½ sec
3000ms = ??? sec
??? = ⅒ sec

### Don’t go off the screen

Position should never be greater than the width

### Track points

* Increase the points amount whenever the box is clicked on
* Speed up whenever the box is clicked on

### Cleanup

* What makes code easier to work with?
* Refactoring - taking working code and making it easier to work with in the future
